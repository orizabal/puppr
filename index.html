            <p> I went onto puppr with a friend to help her pick out a dog. She didnâ€™t get one but I did. The shelter named him Jackson and he fit all my preferences I put on my account. They said he was a runner and picked up by a dog catcher. I took him
                home and two years later and I am as happy as ever with him by my side!</p>

            <p> I was looking for a dog to fill the empty space of my new apartment. Using puppr, I filled in my specifications and it led me to Mellow! She was about 5 months when I adopted her. She was overly mischievous so I trained her, and that's when
                my adventures with Mellow started. I love her and I appreciate the puppr platform for helping me in the process!</p>
